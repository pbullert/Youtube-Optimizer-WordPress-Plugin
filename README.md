# Youtube Optimizer WordPress Plugin

This plugin optimizes embedded Youtube Videos on your website for faster page loads. Youtube's embedding method isnt very efficient, by default it downloads the video player on every occurance of Youtube video; which in return slows down your website. The plugin shows a video thumbnail to your viewer and loads the Youtube video only when the user clicks on the play icon.
